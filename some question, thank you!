Dear KathleenKusworo,

I am sorry to disturb you.

I am Li Xin, a student from Wuhan University, China.

I tested the project "crawl-plos" you pushed, It is very good!

But I still have a question about this because of my shortcoming of knowledge.
I don't know how to parse the json file this project generate, actually, I have generate a file that is about 6GB.
It is very large, so the json.load() is not fit to parse it.
I am not so familar with programming.

so can you give a solution about this problem?
or can we discuss it by e-mail(lucian2015@qq.com)?

Thank you very much!

yours sincerely,
Li Xin
